  <p>Hi my name is Jaelen Upchurch and I am a graphic designer, illustrator, video editor, and photographer.</p>

<p>I tend to be interested in a lot of fields of art which is why I listed so many of my artistic interests. What is so funny about graphic design is that you can use several different styles of art to create something that is considered “graphic design”. What I enjoy the most about my art is the illustration aspect. Drawing has been something I’ve always enjoyed and slowly became something that I knew to be less of a hobby and more of passion turned career path. </p>

<p>My style of illustration is a mix of simplistic and detailed elements combined together to make an interesting composition. Composition is something I heavily try to carry over in all aspects of my art from design to illustration and especially photography. The combination of positive space and negative space is something that i tend to think about when designing. Color has been something I’ve eluded in parts of my life, so I tend to enjoy using blacks, whites, and grays to create emotion within the image. Color isn’t always necessary, but it can add a mood to whatever drawing you have.</p> 

<p>Video editing is another field I really enjoy because of the film element. Editing the video and adding music makes it seem like you are making a movie and it’s always enjoyable to look back on and have fun with. Creating stories behind your stories and seeing the final product of anything in any field and seeing how you got there from point A to point Z is always something to be proud of. </p>
